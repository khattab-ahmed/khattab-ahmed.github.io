## Large Format Printing & Generative Design Overview

Microfluidic devices are designed to process fluids, likely containing small particles, cells, or other reagents, at 
a micro scale. In form, these devices consist of small channels designed in such a way that a specific task is 
completed, like:
  - Mixing small quantities of expensive reagents,
  - Testing new pharmaceutical drugs on organs-on-a-chip, and
  - Sorting specific cells from blood

Many of the most traditional applications exist within the domain of biology and medicine.
