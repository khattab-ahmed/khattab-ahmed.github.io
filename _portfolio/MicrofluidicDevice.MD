This project was for my Additive and Polymer-Based Manufacturing course and resources from Vanderbilt University's Digital Fabrication Lab were used. The purpose of this project was to save babies. 

# CAD Model and YouTube link 

The device was created in Fusion360 and the model is shown below.

 The link to a youtube video of the device working is here. 

# Design Specifications

* The FormLabs Form 3 SLA 3D printer was used to create the mold.



# Print Settings
 

The whole part takes around 2 hours to print on a Form 3 printer with the above-mentioned print settings and then after two iterations the final product was functional microfludic device.

# Process
