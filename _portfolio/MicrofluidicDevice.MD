This project was for my Additive and Polymer-Based Manufacturing course and resources from Vanderbilt University's Digital Fabrication Lab were used. The purpose of this project was to save babies. 

# Design Specifications

* The FormLabs Form 3 SLA 3D printer was used to create the mold.

### Why SLA

The FormLabs Form 3 SLA printer was used to 3D print the mold of the microfluidic device and there is a multitude of reasons why Stereolithography (SLA) or Vat photopolymerization (VPP) was selected to do so including:
* **High Resolution/ Part Accuracy**: VPP printers are capable of producing high-resolution parts with intricate details and a smooth surface finish. This makes SLA printing ideal for creating objects with fine details and complex geometries. The Form 3 specifically has an XY Resolution of 25 microns and a Laser Spot Size of 85 microns. 
* **Surface Finish**: Another advantage of SLA printers is that they can work with a variety of materials, including various types of resins, which can offer different properties such as flexibility, toughness, or transparency. In this project, Black Resin was used based on availability and matte surface finish. 
* **Speed**: SLA printing at a very high detail (.025 mm) can be faster than other 3D printing or additive manufacturing technologies, especially for smaller parts.
* **Watertight**: VPP parts are printed watertight create the actual device, the mold must be pralined and must be smooth an watertight so that the mold can hold. 
* **Minimal post-processing**: Due to the smooth finish, the only required post processing included removing supports, washing the part, and minimal curing (material properties are not crucial in this case).

Due to this projectâ€™s specific use case and all of the benefits mentioned above, SLA was the best 3D printing technology to create the negative mold for the microfluidic device. 


# Print Settings
 
The whole part takes around 2 hours to print on a Form 3 printer with the above-mentioned print settings and then after two iterations the final product was functional microfludic device.



# CAD Model and YouTube link 

The device was created in Fusion360 and the model is shown below.
